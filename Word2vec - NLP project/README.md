# Word2Vec on Quran Translation Data Set

This project aims to explore the representation of words in the Quran translation data set using the Word2Vec technique. The Quran translation data set is provided in the repository and used to train the Word2Vec model.

The model is simple and does not use complex neural network structures. The focus is on understanding the relationships between words and the underlying semantic meaning captured in the text.

The results of this project can be useful for NLP tasks such as text classification, clustering, and visualization. The learned word representations can also be used as features for training other NLP models.

Feel free to contribute to the project by adding more features or improving the current implementation.
