# Text Summerization Project Repository
The Summerization Project Repository contains two distinct folders, each offering a different approach to text summarization with accompanying code. The primary focus of this project is to develop efficient and accurate methods for generating concise summaries of text document

## Pretrained Model Folder
Pretrained Model Folder:
The Pretrained Model folder showcases a text summarization implementation that leverages a pre-trained language model. By utilizing a pre-existing model's knowledge and language understanding, this approach offers a robust and effective solution for summarizing textual content. The code in this folder is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for applying the pre-trained model to various text summarization tasks. The accuracy of the summarization achieved by this method is notably high, making it an excellent choice for those seeking reliable and precise results.

## Without-Pretrained Model Folder
The Non-Pretrained Model folder presents an alternative approach to text summarization that does not rely on pre-existing language models. Instead, this method involves the development of a novel summarization algorithm, designed specifically for this project. The code provided in this folder offers a simplified implementation of the algorithm, ensuring ease of understanding and usage. Despite not utilizing a pre-trained model, this approach still achieves commendable accuracy in generating coherent and meaningful summaries.
